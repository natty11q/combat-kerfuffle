# combat kerfuffle

working on a mini terminal game in python that allows 2 players to duke it out,
this game also circumvents the advantage gained by player 1 by calculating the damage of each turn after the moves are made,
allowing for things like draws,

just for fun :)



edit:

continuing in cpp may return to this py version another time
